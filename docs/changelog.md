## 6.3

### 6.3.0 (2026-9-9)

- feat:
  - **`compose_query` accepts GraphQL variables**: `execute_compose_query`
    and the MCP Layer 3 `compose_query` tool now take a `variables` dict;
    `$var` references in arguments resolve to their values through the
    existing `QueryParser` path (the same one `GraphQLHandler` uses).
    Pass string arguments this way instead of inlining GraphQL literals —
    inline strings containing quotes, backslashes or newlines are the #1
    source of agent-authored parse errors, and variables sidestep escaping
    entirely. A query that declares variables fails fast with a clear
    message naming the missing ones, instead of dying later in argument
    coercion with a cryptic error. Variable default values
    (`$t: String = "x"`) are not applied — they never were on any
    execution path; an omitted defaulted variable now also fails fast,
    with the error naming the limitation (the note appears only when the
    query actually declares a default), instead of silently becoming
    `Undefined`. Backward compatible: `variables` is optional and
    inline-literal queries are unaffected.

## 6.2

### 6.2.1 (2026-9-3)

- fix:
  - **One operation per request, selected per spec (#143)**: A document
    with multiple operations selecting the same top-level group
    cross-contaminated the two selections: on ≤6.1.2 the later
    operation's projection tree silently overwrote the earlier one's —
    a mutation declaring `{ id }` could leak fields only another
    operation asked for (issue #142); since 6.2.0 the same legal
    document raised `ALIAS_CONFLICT` instead. `QueryParser.parse_
    operations()` now keeps per-operation trees, the entity-first
    executor executes exactly ONE operation per request (`operationName`
    matches a named operation, a single anonymous operation runs as-is,
    several without a name errors per spec), and the `operation_name`
    the handler always accepted (the federation transport always passed
    it) finally takes effect. `compose_query` requires exactly one
    operation per document. Single-operation requests — the
    overwhelmingly common case — are unaffected.

### 6.2.0 (2026-9-2)

- feat:
  - **Method-level GraphQL aliases on queries and mutations (#141)**:
    Aliased fields were silently collapsed — the same method invoked N
    times via aliases executed only once (compose) or executed N times
    while overwriting each other down to the last response key
    (entity-first); either way the caller got one result and no signal
    (issue #140). Both paths now support method-level aliases: each alias
    is an independent invocation with its own arguments and sub-field
    projection, and response keys are the aliases. Mutations run serially
    in declaration order — N aliases means N side effects, with no
    execution-level dedup. Nested-field aliases (DTO field renames inside
    a method selection) stay out of scope and now fail loudly instead of
    mis-projecting.

  - **Three-state mutation feedback, operation-scope fail-stop (#141)**:
    A failed mutation no longer voids its whole group: succeeded calls
    keep their results, the failing key becomes `null` with
    `MUTATION_FAILED` (entity-first: `RESOLVER_ERROR`), and every later
    mutation in the same operation is skipped and marked
    `SKIPPED_PRIOR_FAILURE` — across group/service boundaries, matching
    GraphQL's operation-level serial semantics. Queries are unaffected by
    the abort flag and never fail-stop.

  - **Federation wire never carries aliases (#141)**: The mounter-side
    wire renderer emits original field names for aliased nodes — aliases
    terminate at the mounter, members see zero changes and zero alias
    burden.

- behavior change:
  - **Duplicate response keys rejected (#141)**: Alias repeats, an alias
    colliding with a field name, and plain duplicate fields
    (`f { x } f { y }`) used to silently keep only the last selection.
    They now raise an `ALIAS_CONFLICT` error before anything executes;
    field merging is intentionally not supported.

  - **Query failures are per-field (#141)**: A failing query method nulls
    only its own response key with a `QUERY_FAILED` error entry
    (carrying `extensions.service_method`) — on compose the whole
    response used to become `data: null`; on entity-first the whole
    entity group used to be voided. Sibling results now survive on both
    paths.

  - **Error paths use response keys (#141)**: `errors[].path` now uses
    response keys (the alias when present), consistent with the `data`
    keys clients actually received, per the GraphQL spec; messages and
    server logs keep original field names for schema lookups.

- fix:
  - **Cancelled compose queries stop instead of returning 200 (#141)**:
    The concurrent query path (`asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=
    True)`) downgraded `CancelledError` to a `QUERY_FAILED` error entry —
    a cancelled request (client disconnect, `asyncio.timeout`) would keep
    executing its serial mutations and return a normal response.
    Cancellation now propagates: `Exception` becomes a per-field error,
    any other `BaseException` is re-raised.

## 6.1

### 6.1.2 (2026-8-20)

- fix:
  - **Unknown selection fields error instead of silently dropping (#138)**:
    A misspelled field (`{ Team { by_filter { nmae } } }`) passed through
    unvalidated and was dropped at serialization — `success: true` with
    empty-object rows, zero signal for an AI agent to self-correct (found
    by an MCP blind test). Pre-execution selection validation now appends
    a GraphQL-style error ("Cannot query field 'nmae' on type 'Team'") and
    skips only the offending method; sibling methods still execute.
    Paginated packages (`{items, pagination}`) are validated through one
    shared path, so unknown keys name the actual wrapper type
    (`{Entity}{Field}PagePackage` / `{Target}Result`) instead of pointing
    at the entity type.

  - **Resolver errors null the entity group, add RESOLVER_ERROR (#138)**:
    A failed method used to leave an empty-object `Entity: {}` in `data` —
    a misleading "empty success" for clients that read `data` and ignore
    `errors`. Method return types are non-null, so the failure now nulls
    the whole group (GraphQL null propagation at group granularity) and
    the error entry carries `extensions.code = RESOLVER_ERROR` for
    machine-side classification.

  - **`page_by_*_in` order falls back to default_order (#139)**: The
    synthesized federation batch root rendered `order` as optional in SDL,
    but the function body hard-read `kwargs["order"]` — `KeyError` for any
    SDL-direct caller (e.g. an MCP agent) that omitted it. The mounter
    always sent `order` explicitly, so federation e2e tests never exercised
    the omission path. The body now falls back to `page_config.default_order`
    on `None` (invalid strings still fail with Unknown-order-profile), and
    the `__signature__` Parameter carries `default=` so introspection sees
    the real contract.

- breaking change:
  - **Removed superseded per-operation MCP tool modules (#138)**:
    `nexusx.mcp.tools.register_get_operation_schema_tools` /
    `register_list_operations_tools` / `register_graphql_query_tool` /
    `register_graphql_mutation_tool` are removed. These were internal
    wiring helpers with no documented usage; the FastMCP servers themselves
    are unaffected. Use `create_single_app_mcp_server` or the multi-app
    builders instead.

### 6.1.1 (2026-8-14)

- feat:
  - **Voyager member clusters & colors for ComposedErManager (#137)**: A
    composed manager's entities all landed in a single Python-module cluster
    on the voyager pages, making multi-engine deployments indistinguishable
    at a glance. Members that declare `service_name` now cluster under their
    own name on both the ER diagram and the UseCase page (DTOs registered
    via `dto_classes` follow their member), and the opt-in
    `ErManager(color=...)` fills the cluster background. Ownership priority
    is federation service > member `service_name` > Python `__module__`, so
    federation stacking stays orthogonal. Apps that declare nothing render
    byte-identically to before (locked by a golden-file test).

- fix:
  - **Header text color follows fill luminance (#137)**: Node headers kept
    hardcoded white text, illegible on the pastel cluster fills this feature
    recommends. `text_color_for()` now picks black or white by relative
    luminance, and the check runs after the virtual-entity fill override so
    the light yellow `«virtual»` header keeps dark text.

### 6.1.0 (2026-8-13)

- feat:
  - **CLI `--select` field projection (#136)**: Every command generated by
    `create_use_case_cli` now takes `--select` for GraphQL-like field projection
    over the returned DTO — trim JSON output to the fields you want (e.g.
    `--select "name task_count"`, or nested `--select "title owner { name }"`).
    Reuses the same `apply_selection` engine as MCP `compose_query`, so CLI and
    MCP share one selection mechanism. A method's `--help` now lists the return
    DTO's fields (nested relationships marked `selectable`), so you know what
    `--select` can pick. `parse_selection` accepts bare field lists without
    outer braces.

## 6.0

### 6.0.0 (2026-8-10)

- breaking change:
  - **Federation member config orthogonalized to the entity (specs/020, #133)**: Removed
    `AutoQueryConfig.batch_keys` / `batch_pages` and `SubsetConfig.federation_join_key`.
    Member federation capability is now declared on the entity:
    - `__federation_keys__` — which fields are federation batch entry keys; each generates a
      `by_<key>_in` root (`WHERE key IN (values)`).
    - `__pagination_orders__` — the single order-profile carrier: a key in
      `__federation_keys__` additionally yields a `page_by_<key>_in` root, while a local
      relation name yields a local paginated loader (one carrier, routed by
      `__federation_keys__`).
    - γ DTO (`federation_public=True`) join key + order are derived from the source entity's
      `__federation_keys__` / `__pagination_orders__`; `SubsetConfig.federation_join_key` →
      `federation_key` (a selector for multi-key entities, auto for a single key).
    `AutoQueryConfig` now holds only toggles (`default_limit`, `generate_by_id`, ...).
  - **Federation pagination auto-detected, `RemoteRelationship.pagination` removed (specs/021, #134)**:
    The per-edge `RemoteRelationship(pagination=True/False)` parameter is gone.
    Federation pagination is now **auto-detected**: the mounter probes the member's
    `page_by_<join_remote>_in` root (from `__pagination_orders__`) and wires the paged
    loader; the query's `limit`/`order` drive top-N at runtime. `enable_pagination`
    stays local-only (member/mounter symmetric, each its own local relationships).
    Fixes the "per-edge pagination doesn't propagate" gap (multi-hop pagination no
    longer breaks when an intermediate edge forgets `pagination=True`).
  - **Deprecated API cleanup — AppConfig dict + AutoQueryConfig(session_factory)**:
    Removed the legacy `AppConfig` dict form for `create_mcp_server` apps (use `Application`
    instances). Removed `AutoQueryConfig(session_factory)` positional compat (pass
    `session_factory` to `GraphQLHandler` / `Application` instead).
  - **`create_*` factory naming unified**:
    `create_mcp_server` → `create_multi_app_mcp_server`; `create_simple_mcp_server` →
    `create_single_app_mcp_server` (symmetric multi/single); `create_jsonrpc_router` →
    `create_use_case_jsonrpc_router` (`use_case` prefix consistency).

- feat:
  - **DTO auto-discovery — `federation_public` without `dto_classes` (#135)**:
    A DTO with `federation_public=True` is now auto-discovered from its source entity
    (`__subset__.kls`) — no need to pass `dto_classes=[DTO]` to the handler. The metaclass
    registers public DTOs on their source entity; the handler discovers them via its entity
    list. Eliminates the redundant two-step (federation_public + dto_classes).

## 5.4

### 5.4.1 (2026-8-8)

- fix:
  - **Correct stale PyPI metadata and dedupe dev dependencies**:
    Package metadata still advertised `Development Status :: 3 - Alpha` with the
    v0.x-era description "GraphQL SDL generation and query optimization for
    SQLModel", contradicting the README which declared semver-stable maturity back
    at v4.0 — so every PyPI visitor saw an Alpha-tagged, mis-described project.
    Bumped to `5 - Production/Stable` and rewrote the description to reflect the
    current positioning (batch-loaded query graph + multi-protocol methods +
    "for people and AI"). Also collapsed the duplicate `dev` dependency
    definitions: `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` (PEP 621, `pytest>=7`)
    clashed with `[dependency-groups].dev` (PEP 735, `pytest>=9`); the PEP 621
    one was removed and its two unique packages (`pytest-benchmark`, `greenlet`)
    folded into the dependency-groups dev group. `uv sync --all-extras` (CI) is
    unaffected — verified by 1523 tests passing.

### 5.4.0 (2026-8-8)

- feat:
  - **ComposedErManager — compose multiple engines in one process (#132)**:
    Combine several self-contained `ErManager`s (each on its own engine/session)
    into a single query proxy. A resolver from the composed manager traverses
    entities across different databases transparently, with no HTTP bridge — the
    same-process dual of federation (specs/012). Cross-engine edges are declared
    on the composition layer (`cross_relationships=`), so members stay
    self-contained and usable alone. Ships with `GraphQLHandler` / `Application`
    `er_manager=` injection and a `LoaderRegistry` Protocol upgraded from an
    `ErManager` alias to a real contract.

- fix:
  - **Pagination detection uses explicit intent, not structure sniffing (#132)**:
    Detection keyed off the literal `"items"` string, so any ordinary
    relationship named `items` (`Order ── items ── OrderItem`) was misread as a
    paginated package and the parent field was silently dropped — `items` was an
    undocumented reserved word. Producers now return a typed
    `PaginatedPackage` / `KeyedPaginatedPackage`; the build path reads
    `RelationshipInfo.is_paginated`; consumers branch on `isinstance`.
    Relationship naming is free again.

## 5.3

### 5.3.0 (2026-8-7)

- feat:
  - **Use Case voyager federation clusters (#130)**: The Use Case page now
    renders federated remote types like the ER diagram — each owning service
    clusters as a dashed box colored by its declared `RemoteService(color=...)`.
    Previously remote DTO types rendered flat (`module = pydantic.main`) with no
    service boundary. `UseCaseVoyager` takes the `fed_registry` (fed from
    `er_manager._fed_registry` via `VoyagerContext`), tags materialized remote
    types by service, and reuses the existing `Renderer` coloring path; the ER
    diagram path is unchanged and the front-end needs no change (coloring lives
    in the DOT template).

- fix:
  - **`get_return_type` re-resolves placeholder DefineSubset (#131)**: A method
    return annotation is evaluated at `def` time, so a RemoteRef-sourced
    `DefineSubset` froze its placeholder class into the annotation; `federate`
    later replaced the module attribute with the resolved class but the frozen
    annotation missed it, leaving voyager / REST swagger / JSONRPC with the
    placeholder (`SUBSET_REFERENCE = None`) and a broken cross-service subset
    chain. `get_return_type` now re-resolves each class by name against the
    method's module globals (mirroring federate's `setattr`); router, JSONRPC
    and the introspector all route through it, so every consumer sees the
    resolved class with no federation internals leaking into the use_case layer.

## 5.2

### 5.2.0 (2026-8-7)

- feat:
  - **DTO federation γ path (specs/016)**: Compose cross-service graphs at the
    DTO layer. A member marks a `DefineSubset` DTO as federation-public
    (`SubsetConfig(federation_public=True)`), exposing it via
    `/nexusx/dto-introspection` + `/nexusx/dto-batch`; a mounter DTO field then
    references the member public DTO directly (`reviews: list[rev_svc.ReviewDTO]`),
    and the Resolver auto-loads the cross-service tree — no gql string, no manual
    per-row assembly. `Paged(...)` field defaults drive the member's SQL-level
    top-N; the caller overrides per-field via `Resolver(context=...)`. Member
    values are read-only; the mounter adds derived fields via its own
    `resolve_*`/`post_*`. See the β-vs-γ table in `docs/advanced/federation.md`.

  - **DTO-first gql execution (specs/018)**: The entity-first gql path now shares
    the UseCase mental model — a DTO schema is built dynamically from the gql
    selection, then resolved by the Resolver. Activates the previously-dormant
    `response_builder.build_response_model`, extends it to paginated packages +
    federation materialized types, and moves β federation dispatch into the
    Resolver (`fetch_remote_subtree`). The temporary `use_response_builder` flag
    is removed (new path is the only path); flag-on/off equivalence tested.

  - **Unified `core_builder` (specs/021)**: `build_response_model` (entity-first)
    and `build_subset_model` (UseCase compose) are now thin shells over one
    recursive builder, `core_builder.build_model`, parameterized by a
    `FieldResolver` Protocol that abstracts the only real difference — where a
    nested field's type comes from (SQLModel relationships vs pydantic DTO
    annotations). `FieldResolution.nested_shape` collapses the former
    `is_list`/`is_optional`/`nested_annotation_factory` triple into one callable.
    `SelectionError` moved down to `core_builder` (no reverse-import of use_case;
    re-exported for back-compat).

  - **Declarative `Paged` field pagination**: `Annotated[list[X], Paged(limit=N)]`
    as a DTO field default declaratively drives per-parent top-N slicing at the
    member batch root (ROW_NUMBER window); the Resolver merges field defaults +
    caller context per field. Order omitted → member's `default_order`.

  - **Auto-derive `federation_join_key`**: When a federation-public DTO's subset
    has exactly one foreign-key field, `federation_join_key` is auto-derived;
    zero/multiple FKs still require it explicitly. Fail-fast at class creation.

  - **Paged provider (specs/019) / drop `PAGED_MARKER` (specs/020)**: The Resolver
    is decoupled from raw gql paged arguments via an injected provider; the model
    goes back to pure shape (no marker attribute).

- fix:
  - **Pagination chain integrity (GAP A/B/E + γ member checks F1–F3)**: The
    paginated federation path now carries the merged `Paged` params (not
    `PageLoadCommand` objects the remote loader can't unwrap); graphql
    `Undefined`/non-wire values can never reach the wire; an items-only paged
    selection no longer leaks internal RowMapping columns.
  - **`Mapped[list[X]]` relationship `is_list` misclassification** + regression tests.
  - Preserve nullable and paged remote-relationship shapes through the builder.

- refactor:
  - `fetch_dto_subtree` → **`prepare_dto_loader`**: the γ primitive returns a
    prepared loader (it does not fetch); rename makes the β/γ asymmetry honest.
    Added `set_remote_page_params` so all three remote side-channels now have
    explicit setters.
  - `Direction` demoted out of the top-level `__all__` (no production touchpoint;
    still importable from `nexusx.standard_queries`). Non-breaking.

## 5.1

### 5.1.1 (2026-8-6)

- fix:
  - **Support enums nested in input models (#126)**: When an input model field was itself another input model containing an enum, the SDL/introspection enum-collection walk stopped at the outer model and never reached the nested enum — so the generated schema omitted that enum type (or rendered a dangling reference). The walk now recurses through nested input models to collect all reachable enums, and the collection logic is shared between SDL generation and introspection via one helper (`schema_helpers`).

### 5.1.0 (2026-8-2)

- feat:
  - **Local pagination order/direction (`specs/015`)**: Locally-paginated relationships (`enable_pagination=True`, e.g. `Review.comments`) now support query-time `order`/`direction` selection, matching federation pagination's flexibility. A member declares named order profiles on the entity class via `__pagination_orders__ = {relation_name: BatchPageConfig(default_order, orders={profile: PageOrder([OrderTerm(field, direction, nulls)])})}`, and callers query `comments(limit, offset, order: NEWEST, direction: DESC) { items pagination }` — choosing a profile and flipping direction per-query, without redeploying. The sort field stays closed (member owns index control); only the direction is opened up, same model as federation's specs/014.

    The feature reuses federation's sort core rather than reimplementing it: `_resolve_page_orders` validates profiles (enum-safe names, single-column, SQL column, direction, nullable nulls, default∈keys) at startup; the local `page_loader` (`create_page_one_to_many_loader` / `create_page_many_to_many_loader`) builds ORDER BY via `_build_order_expressions(_apply_direction(...))` instead of the fixed `sort_field`; SDL/introspection render the `order` enum + `direction` via the kind-agnostic `federation_order_enum_layout` (local pagination rides the same render path as `REMOTE_PAGED`); and the executor injects `order`/`direction` from `selection.arguments` into the loader command. nulls follow direction flips (`desc+nulls_last ↔ asc+nulls_first`), inherited from `_apply_direction`.

    Declaration lives on the entity class because SQLModel's ORM `Relationship` is not extensible — `Relationship(page_orders=...)` raises `TypeError` (verified at implement time, correcting the spec's initial "extend Relationship" wording). `__pagination_orders__` coexists with `order_by` (profile takes precedence; `order_by` is the fixed fallback when no profile is declared), so every existing locally-paginated relationship keeps its behavior unchanged (zero regression — `test_loader_pagination` / `test_pagination_mixed` / `test_federation_*` all green). Composes with federation pagination: `Product.reviews(limit) { items { comments(order, direction) } }` exercises outer federation pagination and inner local order/direction independently (built on the 5.0.1 fix that made local pagination traverse the federation items subtree).

## 5.0

### 5.0.1 (2026-8-1)

- fix:
  - **Member-side pagination now traverses the federation items subtree (`specs/013` gap)**: When a member owned a locally-paginated relationship (`enable_pagination=True`, e.g. `Review.comments`) and a mounter selected it inside a federation-paginated items subtree (`Product.reviews(limit: 5) { items { comments(limit: 2) { ... } } }`), the mounter crashed with a pydantic `ValidationError`. It materialized the remote `comments` field as a flat `list[Comment]`, but the member returned a `{items, pagination}` package, so `model_validate` rejected the dict. Root cause: ER introspection dropped the member's local-pagination state — `RelDescriptor.pagination` only flagged federation remote pagination (`RemoteRelationship(pagination=True)` with a `target_service`), so the mounter never saw `comments` was paginated on the member side and built a flat-list slot. The federation link layer already supported this case end-to-end — the materializer's package slot (`registry.py`), the renderer's `REMOTE_COALESCED + pagination` branch (`pagination_schema.py`), and the executor's `REMOTE_COALESCED → skip load` (`query_executor.py`) — only the introspection signal was missing. Fix: `serialize_er_introspection` also marks a relationship paginated when it is a local list with a `page_loader` set, so the mounter materializes a package slot, renders `comments(limit, offset)`, and reads the member-filled package without re-loading. One-condition change; the downstream chain was already in place.

### 5.0.0 (2026-8-1)

5.0 adds **federation**: any nexusx service can mount other nexusx services into one unified graph, with no privileged router/gateway role. A client queries the entry service exactly as if it were a monolith; the entry service orchestrates cross-service traversal by issuing **one nested GraphQL query per mounted service**, so each member still resolves its own composed subgraph with its own N+1-proof batch executor — federation does not reintroduce N+1 at the network boundary. The work landed in three layered specs (`specs/012` base federation → `specs/013` remote pagination → `specs/014` query-time order/direction), plus a three-service demo (`demo/federation/`: catalog / reviews / users) and a bilingual guide (`docs/advanced/federation.md`, en + zh). **The version bump to 5.0 reflects this major new surface, not a breaking change to existing APIs**: monolith behavior (SQLModel GraphQL, Resolver, Voyager) is unchanged when `federate` is not used, and the in-process federation APIs renamed/removed during 012 → 013 → 014 (e.g. `RemoteRelationship.order`, the old `by_<key>_in_page(sort_field, sort_direction)` root) never shipped under any tag, so there is no external migration burden.

- feat:
  - **Relative-composition cross-service federation (`specs/012`)**: Mounting is a symmetric capability of every nexusx service — declare a `RemoteRelationship` in `__relationships__` and run `await er.initialize()` at startup; the entry service of a query is its orchestrator (per-query, not per-topology), and mounting a service mounts its entire query surface (including that service's own downstream mounts), so transitive reach is inherent. Composition uses **ER-graph introspection as the source of truth, not SDL** — SDL is a lossy projection that strips FK fields and carries no cardinality/direction, while ER introspection hands over `RelationshipInfo` (with the join key and cardinality) federation actually needs, staying same-source with Voyager and the executor.

    ```python
    from nexusx import RemoteService, RemoteRelationship, ErManager

    reviews = RemoteService("reviews", url="http://reviews:8021")

    class Product(SQLModel, table=True):
        id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
        name: str
        __relationships__ = {
            "reviews": RemoteRelationship(
                fk="id",
                target=list[reviews.Review],   # to-many; bare reviews.Review = to-one
                name="reviews",
                join_remote="product_id",
            )
        }

    er = ErManager(base=..., session_factory=...)
    await er.initialize()   # transitively pulls reviews' ER fragment, validates, materializes
    ```

    Data fetching is done by `RemoteLoader`, a DataLoader that turns a batch of join keys + a nested selection into **one** GraphQL query against the member's `by_<join_remote>_in` root and returns the rows grouped/aligned to the DataLoader's positional contract (missing keys map to `None` for to-one / `[]` for to-many). Remote types are **materialized at init time** (not lazily at runtime) as bare-named pydantic classes via a two-pass `FederatedTypeRegistry` (BFS pull of reachable ER fragments with a visited-set, then topological `create_model` + `model_rebuild` against a bare-name → class namespace), so the external schema shows only bare type names with no service prefix and multi-hop traversal across services is transparent to the client. The canonical `"<srv>.<typename>"` identity lives only in the registry for routing/validation/disambiguation. `RemoteRelationship.target` takes a `RemoteRef` (`RemoteService("srv").TypeName`); a dotted name is not a valid Python identifier, so it is treated as a declaration marker parsed by the framework and never enters Pydantic forward-ref resolution — avoiding fights with forward-ref / `model_rebuild` / mypy at every layer. `DefineSubset` accepts a `RemoteRef` as its source too, and `resolve_deferred_subsets` (run during `federate`) resolves each to the materialized class. **Seven classes of misconfiguration fail-fast at startup**: unknown service prefix, missing typename, missing/incompatible join field, missing `by_<key>_in` root, duplicate service name, duplicate cross-service bare type name, and a mount-graph cycle. Federation requires the optional `nexusx[federation]` extra (httpx); calling `federate()` without httpx raises an informative `ImportError`.

  - **Member-side offset pagination for remote to-many relationships (`specs/013`)**: A mounted to-many relationship can opt into member-side pagination via `RemoteRelationship(..., pagination=True)`. The **physical ordering is owned by the member** (which controls its indexes); the mounter only selects a named semantic order profile. Profiles are declared in `AutoQueryConfig.batch_pages` → `BatchPageConfig(default_order, orders={profile: PageOrder})` → `PageOrder(terms=[OrderTerm])` → `OrderTerm(field, direction, nulls)`, and the member exposes a `page_by_<key>_in(keys, limit, offset, order)` root that paginates per-parent with a window `ROW_NUMBER()`. The business client only ever passes `limit` / `offset`; `total_count` is computed only when selected; primary-key columns not in the profile are appended as a deterministic tie-breaker; a malformed remote response raises `RemoteQueryError` while a legitimately missing key maps to an empty page. ER introspection exposes only the semantic capability (protocol, default order, profile names + descriptions) — never the physical columns, directions, or null ordering. The never-released predecessor root `by_<key>_in_page(sort_field, sort_direction)` was deleted outright with no compatibility shim.

    ```python
    # member side — declares the page capability
    AutoQueryConfig(batch_pages={"Review": {"product_id": BatchPageConfig(
        default_order="NEWEST",
        orders={
            "NEWEST": PageOrder(terms=[OrderTerm(field="created_at", direction="desc")]),
            "HIGHEST_RATING": PageOrder(
                terms=[OrderTerm(field="rating", direction="desc", nulls="last")]),
        },
    )}})
    # client side
    # reviews(limit: 5, offset: 0) { items { title } pagination { has_more total_count } }
    ```

  - **Query-time order/direction for federated pagination (`specs/014`)**: The order-profile choice moves from a deploy-time static binding to a **query-time caller choice**. The mounter renders the member's profile set as a GraphQL `order` enum (values = profile names, default = the member's `default_order`) plus a mounter-owned global `direction` enum (`ASC` / `DESC`) on the paginated relationship field, so a client flips ordering per-query without the member predefining multiple relationships or redeploying. The member's `page_by_<key>_in` gains a `direction` argument; flipping it overrides each profile term's default direction and **nulls follow the flip** (`desc + nulls_last` ↔ `asc + nulls_first`), with the inner window and outer query using byte-identical order expressions. Only the direction is opened up — the sort field stays closed (the member still owns index control); a caller cannot pass an arbitrary sort field, only pick a name and flip direction. `RemoteRelationship.order` is removed (the sole source of order is now the query argument), `federate` validation is relaxed (`pagination=True` no longer requires `order`; instead it requires the member's `page_capability.orders` to be non-empty), and a `PageOrder` is constrained to a single `OrderTerm` (multi-column profiles are rejected at member startup).

    ```graphql
    {
      Product {
        by_filter {
          reviews(limit: 5, offset: 0, order: HIGHEST_RATING, direction: DESC) {
            items { title rating }
            pagination { has_more total_count }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  - **Voyager renders the full federated graph with ownership tags (`specs/012 US4`)**: After federation init, Voyager / ER draws the complete graph (local + remote materialized entities, bare-named), each remote node tagged by its owning service and cross-service edges rendered correctly; an opt-in `RemoteService("reviews", url=..., color=...)` tints a member's cluster.

- internal:
  - **Schema generation is now registry-driven**: SDL generation and `__schema` introspection were switched from `get_type_hints`-based field discovery to reading the `ErManager` registry, so custom/remote relationship fields (which are not type annotations) and materialized remote types reach the external schema — making "rendering" and "execution" same-source. This is the largest non-trivial change to existing modules (`sdl_generator`, `introspection`, `query_executor`, `resolver`, `loader/registry`), but the observable behavior for non-federating single-process apps is unchanged.
  - **RelationshipInfo boolean matrix → kind discriminator**: the local/remote × list/paginated boolean matrix was collapsed into a single `kind` discriminator (plus `target_service`), simplifying executor routing of remote relationships.

- known limitations:
  - Federation is **read-only** this release (no cross-service writes/mutations).
  - Cross-service joins are **single-field** (composite keys are rejected by validation).
  - Join-key types are limited to `{str, int, float, bool, UUID}`; **`Decimal` is rejected** at `federate()` — root cause: the member's `page_by` buckets rows by SQL column value while the federation wire carries string keys, so a non-string-wire type like `Decimal` can't match a bucket (UUID passes only because SQLite stores UUID columns as strings). This is the documented type-gap from `specs/013`.
  - A federated pagination order profile is **single-column** (multi-column `PageOrder` is rejected at member startup).
  - Order/direction selection covers only the **β path** (GraphQL direct query into the mounter); choosing order from the **γ path** (Resolver / UseCase business-code composition) is explicitly out of scope for this release.
  - Cross-service **bare type names must be unique** (duplicates fail-fast at startup), and the federation runs on an **internal trusted network** (no auth / multi-tenant passthrough this release). A member adding fields at runtime is not hot-detected — restart the entry service to re-init.

- compatibility:
  - **Monolith: zero regression.** Without `federate`, the SQLModel GraphQL surface, Resolver / Core-API path, and Voyager are unchanged (the single-process test suite stays green). The 5.0 major bump is for the major new federation surface, not for breakage.

## 4.0

### 4.0.0 (2026-7-20)

- breaking change:
  - **SQLModel GraphQL root restructured from flat fields to per-entity grouping (#115)**: A `@query`/`@mutation` method like `User.get_by_id` is now queried as `{ User { get_by_id(id: 1){} } }` instead of the flat `{ userGetById(id: 1){} }`. The root `Query`/`Mutation` mount one field per entity (`User: UserQuery!`), and each method lives on a synthesized `{Entity}Query`/`{Entity}Mutation` group type under its **original Python name** (no camelCase, no entity prefix) — mirroring the UseCaseService `Service { method {} }` convention so the query surface stays legible as entities and methods grow. Auto-generated `by_id`/`by_filter` and pagination land inside the group automatically; pagination itself is unaffected (it only wraps relationship fields, never method returns or root fields). Selecting a bare entity group (`{ User }`) returns a friendly `BARE_GROUP_FIELD` error listing the available methods. Name collisions the old flat prefix used to mask are now rejected eagerly at startup (`DuplicateEntityError`, `DuplicateMethodError`, `ReservedMethodFieldError`, `ReservedEntityError`). The UseCaseService/compose GraphQL path is unchanged.

    **Migration**: rewrite query strings — `entityPrefixMethodCamel` (e.g. `userGetById`) → `{ Entity { method {} } }` (e.g. `{ User { by_id {} } }`); response paths nest one level deeper (`data["userGetById"]` → `data["User"]["by_id"]`). MCP tools `get_query_schema`/`get_mutation_schema` now take explicit `entity` + `method` (was a single flat `name`); `list_queries`/`list_mutations` return `{entity, method, name}` entries.

- feat:
  - **demo launcher regrouped + MCP added to the paginated blog demo (#115)**: `start_all.sh` is reorganized around the README's two-pillar model (Query surface / Core API / Business-logic / Visualization), prints per-port capability tags (GraphQL / MCP / REST / Voyager), and lists every endpoint. The paginated blog demo now serves both GraphQL and MCP on one port (`/graphql` + `/mcp/mcp`).

- fix:
  - **multi-app MCP demo crashed at startup since 3.7.0 (#115)**: `demo/multi_app/mcp_server.py` subscripted the self-contained `Application` object as a dict (`app['name']`), raising `TypeError: 'Application' object is not subscriptable` on boot after 3.7.0's `Application` refactor — fixed to attribute access.
  - **paginated blog demo moved off port 8005 (#115)**: Windows reserves 8005 for Windows Hello, so browsers visiting the demo on :8005 popped a "sign in to access this site" dialog. Moved to 8015.

## 3.7

### 3.7.0 (2026-7-19)

- feat:
  - **Self-contained `Application` class (specs/009-app-self-contained)**: `nexusx.mcp.Application` is now the minimal exportable unit of a "business app" in the MCP system. An `Application` bundles a SQLModel `base` + one of three mutually-exclusive connection inputs (`url` / `engine` / `session_factory`, or none) + GraphQL metadata, so it can be shipped as an independent Python package (`pip install blog-app`) and assembled into a gateway via `create_multi_app_mcp_server(apps=[...])`. This fully decouples the app's schema/connection definition from the MCP server that runs it.

    Key designs: **resource ownership follows the source** — the `url=` path owns the engine it creates and `dispose()` tears it down; `engine=` / `session_factory=` are treated as external and `dispose()` is a no-op (avoids double-dispose, releasing foreign engines, and leaks). **Three connection forms are mutually exclusive**, validated at construction (`ValueError("Provide at most one of: url, engine, session_factory")`). **Schema-only mode** — construct with no connection args for pure schema introspection (`entity_names` / SDL), the key case for distributing an app as a package whose author doesn't know the user's DB URL. **Idempotent `dispose()`** guards three overlapping exits (MCP server lifespan shutdown, `async with Application(...)`, explicit `await dispose()`). **URL credentials are redacted** in `__repr__` and error messages (via SQLAlchemy `make_url().render_as_string(hide_password=True)`). **Cross-app name conflicts fail at construction** in `MultiAppManager` rather than at runtime.

    ```python
    from nexusx.mcp import Application, create_multi_app_mcp_server

    # Single app standalone (schema introspection + direct query)
    blog = Application(name="blog", base=BlogBase, url="sqlite+aiosqlite:///blog.db")
    print(blog.resources.entity_names)
    result = await blog.resources.handler.execute("{ users { id name } }")

    # Multiple apps composed into one MCP server
    mcp = create_multi_app_mcp_server(apps=[blog, shop], name="Gateway")
    mcp.run()  # lifespan exit disposes all owned engines
    ```

- deprecation:
  - **dict-based `AppConfig` → `Application`**: The legacy dict form (`{"name": ..., "base": ..., "url": ...}`) **still works** but emits a `DeprecationWarning` on every construction, and will be **removed in 3.8.0**. The dict is transparently coerced to an `Application` with identical behavior, so migration is a purely mechanical swap:

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    create_multi_app_mcp_server(apps=[{"name": "blog", "base": BlogBase, "url": "..."}], name="Gateway")
    # After
    create_multi_app_mcp_server(apps=[Application(name="blog", base=BlogBase, url="...")], name="Gateway")
    ```

    Compatibility window: 3.7.x keeps the dict form with a warning; 3.8.0 removes it. Migrate before upgrading to 3.8.

- fix:
  - **use_case router no longer flattens nested `BaseModel` params to dict (#110, fixes #107)**: Handlers generated by `create_router` used `body.model_dump()`, flattening the FastAPI-validated request model into a dict before calling the service method. When a method signature declared nested `BaseModel` params (`list[ItemInput]` / `ItemInput` / `ItemInput | None`), the body actually received `list[dict]` / `dict` — the signature lied at runtime and `item.text` raised `AttributeError`. The fix switches to per-field attribute access (`getattr(body, name)`), so the nested `BaseModel` instances Pydantic built during validation are passed through unchanged. Scalars / `list[scalar]` / `FromContext` / defaults / aliases are unaffected, as are the OpenAPI and compose-schema paths (schema generation and the router are orthogonal).

- behavior change:
  - **`route_options` rejects router-reserved keys (#111)**: Cleanup following #107. Most of the change is internal and user-invisible: `_make_handler` extracts shared logic, drops a dead branch (`elif pname not in kwargs` was always true because body and context params are disjoint) and an unused parameter, and gives generated handler closures meaningful `__name__` / `__qualname__` (better tracebacks and FastAPI-generated operation_ids). The one observable change: passing `endpoint` or `methods` in `route_options` previously raised a confusing `TypeError: got multiple values for keyword argument` at route registration; it now raises a clear `ValueError` at `create_router()` time. `path` and other keys remain overridable.

## 3.6

### 3.6.2 (2026-7-15)

- fix:
  - **`@query`/`@mutation` returning bare scalars or `list[scalar]` is no longer wrapped as `{"_value": ...}` (#106)**: The fallback branch of `_serialize_item` stuffed every "non-Pydantic-model + no sub-selection" return value into `{"_value": str(item)}` — a defensive holdover from when the function was entity-only. Common mutation patterns returning bare scalars (`delete_xxx() -> bool`, `count_xxx() -> int`, `reorder() -> list[UUID]`) have no sub-selection, so they all hit this branch and produced `{"_value": "True"}` / `[{"_value": "..."}]` — matching neither the SDL-declared `Boolean!` nor a JSON-native value. This was the symmetric gap left by the 3.6.0/3.6.1 UUID work: the input direction was fixed, but method return values on the output direction were still broken. The fallback now routes through `_serialize_scalar_value`, which uses Pydantic's `TypeAdapter(type(value)).dump_python(value, mode="json")` to handle `bool`/`int`/`str` natively, stringify `UUID`, and cover `datetime`/`Decimal`/`Enum`/`set`/`tuple`/nested lists uniformly. **Behavior change** (strictly a fix): responses for bare-scalar returns change from `{"_value": str(...)}` to the raw value (`true` / `42` / `"hello"` / `["uuid1", "uuid2"]`). The `{"_value": ...}` shape never matched the SDL contract, so no real client could have depended on it.

### 3.6.1 (2026-7-14)

- fix:
  - **`list[UUID]` / `list[datetime]` argument types no longer pass through unconverted (#105)**: 3.6.0 fixed single-UUID input conversion, but `ArgumentBuilder._convert_scalar_value` returned `value` as-is for generic `list[T]` / `List[T]` targets — the whole list passed through with elements unconverted. So `@mutation reorder(cls, ids: list[UUID])` received a `list[str]`, and SQLModel/SQLAlchemy raised `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'hex'` when binding a UUID column, with a traceback that didn't point at nexusx. The blast radius was wider than UUID: `list[datetime]` / `list[date]` / `list[time]` args had the same defect, just unexposed because nobody had written such a signature yet. Fixed generically rather than UUID-specifically: `_convert_scalar_value` now recurses into `list` (detect via `typing.get_origin`, convert each element via itself). Empty lists, `Optional[list[T]]`, and element-level `Optional[T]` all fall out naturally; existing bare-scalar branches are unchanged.

### 3.6.0 (2026-7-14)

- breaking change:
  - **UUID promoted to a real GraphQL UUID scalar (#104)**: Python's `uuid.UUID` was previously split across two GraphQL paths and wrong on both. The main path (`sdl_generator` + `TypeConverter`) rendered UUID fields/args as `String` via an `or "String"` fallback; the compose path (`compose_type_mapper`) mapped UUID to `ID`. Both diverged from the explicit `uuid.UUID` type. Worse on the input direction: a `@query` declaring `id: UUID` received a `str` at runtime (`ArgumentBuilder` only recognized `datetime`/`date`/`time`), and SQLModel/SQLAlchemy crashed with `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'hex'` on UUID-column binding — a traceback that didn't point at nexusx.

    UUID is now a first-class scalar on both paths, on par with `DateTime`/`Date`/`Time`: SDL renders `UUID` / `UUID!`, transport is unchanged (still string-serialized), and introspection advertises the `UUID` scalar in `__schema`.

    **Breaking impact:** Main path — UUID fields change from `String` to `UUID`; since `String` was a fallback bug rather than a contract, main-path users perceive this as a fix (SDL type name changes, but SQLModel apps go from crashing to working). Compose path — UUID fields change from `ID` to `UUID`; this is the genuinely breaking surface, as SDL consumers like `graphql-codegen`/Apollo see a new scalar name and must regenerate types. Transport (string serialization) is unchanged — purely an SDL surface change.

## 3.5

### 3.5.3 (2026-7-10)

- breaking change:
  - **Removed the `Op` wrapper layer from UseCase compose queries**: Compose queries previously required a virtual top-level `Op` field — `{ Op { UserService { list_users { id } } } }`. The wrapper had no business meaning; it was a placeholder from an early implementation aligning to graphql-core's default `Query` root, forcing every query one indent deeper and making every MCP example and doc explain it. Queries now start directly at the service: `{ UserService { list_users { id } } }`. `execute_compose_query`, the MCP Layer 3 `compose_query` tool, and the GraphiQL endpoint all reject the old shape uniformly, with error `Service 'Op' not found in app '<name>'. Available: [...]`. The change is localized to `_execute_operations`, which now dispatches `selections.items()` straight to services instead of unwrapping a root `FieldSelection` first.

### 3.5.2 (2026-7-3)

- fix:
  - **Voyager node switching no longer leaves an orange border residue on the old node (#101)**: `graph-ui.js::highlightSchemaBanner` set `stroke`/`stroke-width`/`fill` via `setAttribute` and stashed the originals in `data-original-*` DOM attributes, but `clearSchemaBanners` only `removeAttribute`d those data attributes without writing the originals back to the SVG attributes — it relied on `graphviz.svg.js::restoreElement`, whose data source (a jQuery fill+stroke snapshot taken at init, without stroke-width) was independent of graph-ui.js's writes. After switching nodes the title background restored correctly, but a faint orange stroke lingered on the outer frame. Fix: `clearSchemaBanners` now reads the `data-original-*` attributes and writes them back to the SVG attributes before removing them, making graph-ui.js the last writer that overrides any inconsistency. graphviz.svg.js (vendored) is untouched; restore semantics are "write back the original value" rather than "repaint a fixed color", so theme/dark-mode changes stay compatible.

### 3.5.1 (2026-7-3)

- fix:
  - **Voyager ER diagram: Related Entities sub-graph now refreshes when display options change (#100)**: After `renderErDiagram` re-rendered the main graph, the Related Entities sub-graph wasn't refetched — `onGenerate` dispatched only to the main path, and `fetchRelatedEntities` had a dedup guard (spec 005 FR-011) that short-circuited when `selectedSchema === schemaName`. So toggling any display option while the sub-graph was open left it on stale data. Fix: after the main render, if a sub-graph is open, clear `selectedSchema` (bypassing the dedup guard) and refetch. The dedup guard still fires for genuine repeated clicks on the same entity with no config change.

### 3.5.0 (2026-7-3)

- feat:
  - **Voyager ER diagram: "Hide Reverse Relationships" toggle (#99)**: SQLModel bidirectional relationships (`Relationship(back_populates=...)`) are split by SQLAlchemy into two opposite directions — a MANYTOONE (FK holder → referenced) and an ONETOMANY (the reverse mirror). Voyager previously drew both, so every bidirectional pair showed two redundant edges and the canvas got dense. The new toggle keeps only MANYTOONE (and MANYTOMANY) edges and hides the ONETOMANY mirrors, halving the edge count between any pair. Filtering happens at the entry of `ErDiagramDotBuilder._add_relationship_link` via an early return on `RelationshipInfo.direction == 'ONETOMANY'` — no anchor/label logic changes, and surviving edges look identical, just fewer. Field tables are unaffected (only edges are trimmed). The sub-graph follows automatically. The preference persists to `localStorage` (`hide_reverse_relationships`, default off for backward compat); the Pydantic payload field defaults to `False` so old clients behave identically.

## 3.4

### 3.4.2 (2026-7-2)

- fix:
  - **SDL now emits `limit`/`offset` args on paginated list fields (#98)**: With `enable_pagination=True`, the introspection path rendered `limit`/`offset` args on paginated list fields, but the SDL generator emitted the same field with no args — two inconsistent descriptions of one schema. GraphQL requires field args to be declared in SDL or clients can't pass them, so pagination was effectively unreachable for any client consuming SDL (AI agents, codegen, GraphiQL alternatives, doc generators). Fix: `SDLGenerator._generate_entity_type` reuses `_is_paginated_relationship` and emits `{field}(limit: Int, offset: Int = 0): {Type}Result!` for `page_loader`-bearing list fields; other fields are unchanged. `offset`'s default `0` matches introspection's `defaultValue: "0"`.

### 3.4.1 (2026-7-1)

- feat:
  - **Voyager ER diagram: `Better Cluster Display` toggle (for module clusters)**: Large ER diagrams with "Show Module Cluster" on suffered from severe edge rerouting and unstable in-cluster rendering. A new toggle — visible only in ER-diagram mode with Show Module Cluster enabled — applies a set of Graphviz routing params better suited to large clustered graphs: `splines=polyline`, `newrank=true`, `compound=true`. When off, original Graphviz behavior is preserved. The toggle sits indented under Show Module Cluster, persists to `localStorage`, and auto-hides + resets when Show Module Cluster turns off.

### 3.4.0 (2026-7-1)

- feat:
  - **Voyager ER diagram: "About" tab (docstring + Mermaid) & wider sidebar (#95)**: The sidebar opened on double-click previously had only Fields / Source Code / Related Entities tabs; the schema model's `__doc__` had no entry point. A new leftmost **About** tab renders the class docstring as GitHub-Flavored Markdown (headings, lists, tables, code blocks, blockquotes, rules), with ```mermaid fences (`stateDiagram-v2`/`flowchart`/`sequenceDiagram`/…) rendered inline. Malformed mermaid blocks degrade to an error notice + collapsed source (copy-out friendly); a single block failing doesn't break the rest. The sidebar drag width rose from a fixed 800px to `floor(viewport × 2/3)` (300px floor preserved), auto-clamping on resize. The docstring is served by a dedicated `POST /docstring` endpoint (mirroring `/source`/`/vscode-link`) to avoid bloating the initial ER payload; it's rendered through `marked` → `DOMPurify` → hardened links (`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`) and is read-only. `marked`/`dompurify`/`mermaid` load from CDN and are pre-cached by the service worker for offline use.

## 3.3

### 3.3.1 (2026-6-30)

- fix:
  - **Voyager ER-diagram sidebar: field descriptions restored**: `ErDiagramDotBuilder._get_entity_fields` dropped `desc` for both field kinds — plain `model_fields` didn't read `v.description`, and relationship fields lost their `description` when converted to `RelationshipInfo`. So the sidebar Fields table's Description column was always empty even when the schema declared `Field(description=...)` or `CustomRelationship(description=...)`. The sibling DTO path (`get_pydantic_fields`) was always correct, so non-ER views were unaffected (which hid the bug). Fix: pass `desc=getattr(v, 'description', None) or ''` on plain fields (matching `type_helper.py`), and add a `description` field to `RelationshipInfo` propagated from `Relationship.description` for relationship fields. ORM-auto-discovered relationships still have no description (expected).

### 3.3.0 (2026-6-30)

- feat:
  - **Voyager ER diagram: "Related Entities" focused sub-graph tab (#93)**: In large schemas (30+ entities) like `demo/enterprise_voyager`, "click to highlight one-hop neighbors" scatters related nodes across the canvas. A new third sidebar tab **Related Entities** renders a read-only mini ER sub-graph containing only the selected entity, its direct neighbors, and the edges between them. The sub-graph reuses the main graph's render config (module cluster / methods / edge length) and re-renders on config or selection change; it exposes no config of its own. The visual pipeline mirrors the main graph (backend returns DOT, front-end renders via an independent d3-graphviz instance so zoom/pan/layout state don't interfere). It's read-only (no click/dblclick rebinding) but keeps pan/zoom. Isolated entities render as a lone node with a "no direct relationships" notice.
- fix:
  - **Sidebar follows canvas selection; blank-click vs drag-gesture separated (#93)**: While building the Related Entities tab, two sidebar responsiveness issues were found and fixed: (1) after opening the sidebar via double-click, single-clicking another entity on the canvas didn't update the sidebar (only double-click did — counterintuitive); (2) clicking blank canvas closed the sidebar, but so did drag-panning. Single-click now updates the sidebar when it's open (idempotent with the double-click path); blank-click close uses a mousedown/mouseup 5px movement threshold so pure clicks close but drags (pan/box-select) don't. A protective comment was added to `resetState()` documenting that tab selection must persist across entity switches.

## 3.2

### 3.2.3 (2026-6-29)

- fix:
  - **Voyager source-location now accepts fully-qualified class names outside the service module**: `VoyagerContext._resolve_object` restricted module names to the service module's scope, but Voyager/ER UI node names can be any type collected during graph analysis — DTOs, entities, loaders, test helper schemas — often defined outside the service module. Names like `tests.test_voyager_security._LocalSchema` were wrongly rejected, surfacing as "invalid format" or broken VS Code links. Fix: drop the service-module allowlist, resolve loaded modules from `sys.modules` first, fall back to import, return `None` on import failure. The `Service.method` path is preserved.

### 3.2.2 (2026-6-29)

- fix:
  - **Self-/mutually-referential DTOs no longer stack-overflow schema construction (#91)**: `ComposeTypeMapper._register_object`/`_register_input_object` wrote the `TypeInfo` to its memos only **after** walking all fields, so self-referential (`parent: Self | None`, `children: list[Self]`) or mutually-referential (`A.b: B` + `B.a: A`) DTOs recursed into the self-reference before the memo existed, ran to `RecursionError`, and crashed `build_compose_schema` at startup. Fix: write a `fields=()` stub `TypeInfo` into both memos **before** the field walk, so re-entry short-circuits on the memo; after the walk, `dataclasses.replace(stub, fields=...)` fills the real fields (`TypeInfo` is frozen). `TypeRef` is name-based, so downstream consumers always see the finalized version.
  - **SQLModel `date`/`time` fields natively supported end-to-end in GraphQL (#92)**: SQLModel entities declaring `when: date`/`start_time: time` were treated as strings across the GraphQL chain — SDL misreported `String!`, mutation calls passed the string through to SQLModel triggering `TypeError: SQLite Date type only accepts Python date objects`, and GraphiQL introspection never exposed `Date`/`Time` scalars. Three local fixes route `date`/`time` through the same path as `datetime`: `TypeConverter.SCALAR_TYPE_MAP` adds `date → "Date"` / `time → "Time"` (SDL and introspection stop falling back to `String` automatically); `ArgumentBuilder._convert_scalar_value` adds `date`/`time` branches using `date.fromisoformat`/`time.fromisoformat`; the hardcoded scalar list in `IntrospectionGenerator._build_scalar_types` adds `"Date"`/`"Time"` so GraphiQL can discover them.

### 3.2.1 (2026-6-26)

- fix:
  - **`serialize_result` now uses JSON mode + recursive dict serialization (#90)**: Port of pydantic-resolve v5.10.4. `use_case/serialization.py:serialize_result` — the sole serialization path for JSON-RPC and CLI response assembly — failed for non-JSON-native types (`UUID`/`datetime`/`Decimal`), especially when a use case method returned a **dict payload containing them**: `model_dump()` defaulted to `mode="python"` (leaving them as Python objects), dicts were returned without recursion (leaking nested UUID/BaseModel), and the catch-all bypassed JSON conversion. Callers hit `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` at `json.dumps`, pointing away from `serialize_result`. Fix: everything goes through Pydantic JSON mode — `model_dump(mode="json")`, recursive dict (`{k: serialize_result(v) …}`), and a `TypeAdapter(type(result)).dump_python(result, mode="json")` catch-all. The function previously had **no unit tests**; 12 were added covering the regression core (dict-with-UUID) and adjacent cases.

### 3.2.0 (2026-6-26)

- feat:
  - **Non-SQLModel root objects (virtual entities) (#87)**: Plain `pydantic.BaseModel` subclasses are now first-class participants in NexusX resolution and ER visualization, without a SQLModel subclass or underlying table. Previously `DefineSubset` required a SQLModel source, so using a non-ORM root (FastAPI `CurrentUser` from OIDC claims, page wrappers, third-party SDK DTOs) required hacking `_subset_registry`. Three capabilities land together:

    - `ErManager.add_virtual_entities([...])` registers plain BaseModel subclasses into the ER graph as peers of SQLModel entities — usable as `Resolver` roots, able to declare `__relationships__`, participating in ExposeAs/SendTo/Collector cross-layer flows, and rendered as visually-distinct virtual nodes. Must be called before the first `create_resolver()` (the registry freezes afterward; a later call raises `RuntimeError`). SQLModel classes are rejected here (they still go through `__init__`'s `entities=`/`base=`); duplicates raise `ValueError`; non-classes/non-BaseModels raise `TypeError`.
    - `DefineSubset.__subset__` source widens from `type[SQLModel]` to `type[BaseModel]` — "subset" is a schema-level concept (selecting fields from `model_fields`), independent of data source. The two APIs are orthogonal: a BaseModel can be (a) only a virtual entity, (b) only a DefineSubset source, (c) both, (d) neither.
    - ER/Voyager render virtual entities with a yellow fill (`#FFF9C4`), a `«virtual»` UML stereotype, and a dashed `cluster_virtual` subgraph — visually distinct from DB-backed entities, readable in black-and-white print. Two entry points: `ErDiagram.from_er_manager(er)` (data API, `.to_mermaid()`) and `ErDiagramDotBuilder(er).render_dot()` (DOT path, used by Voyager). With zero virtual entities the DOT output is byte-identical to baseline.

    Supporting changes: `_resolve_source()` unifies source lookup for three root kinds (DefineSubset DTO, registered virtual entity, unregistered BaseModel); an unregistered BaseModel declaring `__relationships__` now raises a clear `RuntimeError` pointing to `add_virtual_entities` instead of silently skipping (spec Edge Case B). CUSTOM-relationship loader output is projected to the declared DTO type via `isinstance(r, dto_cls)` (previously `isinstance(r, BaseModel)`, which silently skipped projection). DefineSubset auto-includes `__relationships__` FK fields for BaseModel sources (mirroring SQLModel FK auto-include). Migration: the old `_subset_registry[X] = Y` hack maps to `add_virtual_entities` / `DefineSubset` / plain-virtual depending on intent. See `docs/guide/virtual_entities.md` and `docs/reference/migration.md`.

## 3.1

### 3.1.3 (2026-6-24)

- fix:
  - **Pagination `has_more` off-by-one (#86)**: Pagination loaders reported `has_more=False` when exactly one row remained after the current page, so clients stopped paging and the last row was silently dropped. Root cause: M2O/M2M paths computed `has_next_page = total_count > offset + 1 + effective_limit`, counting the SQL peek-by-1 row as "already returned"; correct semantics is `total_count > offset + effective_limit`. Fix: use the already-fetched peek row directly — `has_next_page = len(grouped[fk]) > effective_limit`. The peek-by-1 design exists precisely to answer this; deriving from `total_count` reintroduced the off-by-one. `total_count` now only populates the response payload, not the boolean. (E.g. `total=5, offset=0, limit=4`: was `False` ❌, now `True`.)
- behavior change:
  - **`enable_pagination` now warn-skips instead of all-or-nothing blocking startup (#83)**: `ErManager(enable_pagination=True)` previously required **every** ORM list relationship to configure `order_by`, else startup raised `ValueError` — forcing placeholder `order_by="id"` on audit logs, append-only event streams, config dicts, or abandoning pagination entirely. Startup now logs a WARNING per skipped `Entity.field` and proceeds. Skipped relationships use the regular loader and render as `[T]!` (not `Result<T>`) automatically — those paths already branch on `page_loader is not None`, zero downstream change. WARNING (not silent) so users can see which lists were skipped and filter the log if desired. No `strict_pagination` opt-in or explicit opt-out added (YAGNI).

### 3.1.2 (2026-6-24, untagged)

Port of pydantic-resolve v5.10.2 (`184886d`) — three `INPUT_OBJECT` correctness fixes for the UseCase compose surface. Before this release nexusx registered every Pydantic `BaseModel` as a GraphQL `OBJECT` whether it appeared as a method return or argument, violating the GraphQL spec (input types must be `INPUT_OBJECT`) and crashing with `DuplicateTypeError` when the same class was used as both.

- fix:
  - **BaseModel method args are now registered as `INPUT_OBJECT` (US1)**: `@mutation create_task(payload: CreateTaskInput)` previously registered `CreateTaskInput` as `OBJECT`, so GraphiQL refused to render and `graphql.build_client_schema` failed. New `ComposeTypeMapper.map_python_type_as_input(py_type)` routes method args; `_map_leaf` dispatches BaseModel leaves to a new `_register_input_object` (`kind=INPUT_OBJECT`, populates `input_fields`); each input field's `default_value` comes from the pydantic field default rendered as a GraphQL literal. Mutable defaults (`default_factory`) remain unsupported.
  - **The same BaseModel as both return and arg no longer crashes (US2)**: `upsert_task(patch: TaskDTO) -> TaskDTO` previously raised `DuplicateTypeError` (bare class name taken by the return side). `build_compose_schema` is now two-phase: register all return-side OBJECTs first, then all arg-side INPUT_OBJECTs (phase order is load-bearing — only with OBJECT taking the bare name does the input-side rename branch fire). On conflict (`bare name taken by OBJECT` + `python_class is cls`), the input type auto-renames to `{Name}Input` (e.g. `TaskDTO` → `TaskDTOInput`). Distinct classes sharing `__name__` still raise `DuplicateTypeError`. Nested inputs close over consistently.
  - **Method-level SDL now expands `INPUT_OBJECT` types (US3)**: `render_method_sdl` previously collected only the return closure and treated `INPUT_OBJECT` as a leaf, so SDL referenced `input CreateTaskInput { ... }` without ever defining it — readers/AI agents saw incomplete SDL. `_collect_closure` now recurses into `input_fields`; `_render_method_sdl` collects closures from both return and arg type-refs; `_emit_type_sdl` reads `input_fields` for `INPUT_OBJECT` and renders `name: Type = literal` defaults.
- spec-compliance:
  - **GraphiQL canonical introspection round-trip**: A hard gate feeds GraphiQL's standard startup introspection query through `compose_introspect`, then `graphql.build_client_schema` — any spec violation (INPUT_OBJECT field misplaced on OBJECT, dangling type ref, malformed default) makes `build_client_schema` raise. Regression invariants explicitly assert that apps with no BaseModel args introduce zero `INPUT_OBJECT` TypeInfo and that SCALAR/ENUM TypeInfo never carry `python_class`.

### 3.1.1 (2026-6-24)

- fix:
  - **`_orm_to_dto` preserves DB NULL (BUG_1_2)**: `Resolver._orm_to_dto` filtered out `None`, so DB NULL was silently replaced by the DTO field's `Field(default=...)`. NULL and "explicit default" became indistinguishable in API responses — "unrated" vs "rated zero" both showed 0; timestamps with `default_factory=datetime.now` lost meaning. Fix: pass field values (including None) straight through; if the DTO field isn't `Optional`, Pydantic validation raises (a correct schema-mismatch signal). Only the auto-load path (`_orm_to_dto`) is affected; direct `DTO.model_validate(orm)` is unchanged.
  - **QueryExecutor per-field exceptions are now logged (BUG_1_3)**: When the resolver raised (e.g. an `AttributeError` inside a `@query` method), `QueryExecutor` only stuffed the message into the response `errors` and wrote **no log** — `query_executor.py` didn't even `import logging`. Server bugs were invisible to log-based alerting (Sentry/Loki/CloudWatch). Fix: the per-field except still returns the GraphQL-spec `{message, path}` but additionally calls `logger.exception(...)`, so traceback + exception type + line land in server logs. Response shape unchanged.
  - **`post_default_handler` + `default_handler` field-conflict detection (BUG_1_6)**: `post_default_handler` is a reserved name (a finalizer running after all `post_*`, not auto-bound to a field), but the `post_<field>` convention strongly implied it would fill a `default_handler` field. Defining both silently dropped the method's return and left the field at default — zero warning; the constant wasn't even exported. Now defining **both** raises `ValueError` from `_build_class_meta` with three fix paths (rename method / drop field / assign manually); either alone behaves as before.
- chore:
  - **CLAUDE.md slimmed to pure behavior constraints**: CLAUDE.md previously held ~200 lines of tech details (stack, structure, public API list, commands, pitfalls) duplicating `pyproject.toml`/`__init__.py`/source and drifting (review found version/dir/API lists 2 majors stale). Simplified to a 17-line "dev notes" section; all tech detail now lives in source/pyproject as single source; CLAUDE.md added to `.gitignore`. (Review test infra moved out of `tests/`.)

### 3.1.0 (2026-6-23)

- feat:
  - **Resolver `loader_instances` parameter**: Port of pydantic-resolve's `Resolver(loader_instances=...)`. Callers pass pre-created (typically primed) DataLoader instances, matched by class, to skip redundant batch calls for known keys. `Resolver(loader_instances={LoaderClass: instance})` returns the caller's instance when a `resolve_*` method declares `loader=Loader(Cls)` with `Cls` in the dict; otherwise behavior is unchanged. Construction validates that keys are `aiodataloader.DataLoader` subclasses and values are instances of the key (raises `TypeError` at construction, never entering traversal). Instances are used by reference (not copied) and not cleaned up by `resolve()` — the caller owns the lifecycle. `ErManager.create_resolver()` forwards `loader_instances`. Scope: only the explicit `Loader(Cls)` Depends path; auto-load (custom relationships, ORM relationships) is untouched. Strictly equivalent to pydantic-resolve; only difference is `TypeError` (vs upstream's `AttributeError`).
- chore:
  - **Tree-wide `ruff --fix` + uv.lock sync (PR #82)**: `ruff check --fix` cleaned 49 lint issues (mostly redundant inline `from typing import Annotated` in benchmarks/demo/tests already imported at top). `uv.lock`: nexusx 3.0.0 → 3.0.1 (a prior bump had missed the lock). No mirror source introduced (still `pypi.org`). 16 `Optional[X] → X | None` hints needing `--unsafe-fixes` were left.

## 3.0

### 3.0.1 (2026-6-23)

- fix:
  - **`use_case.cli` no longer hard-requires `typer` at import**: `use_case/cli.py` did `try: import typer except ImportError: raise` at module top, so `import nexusx` (via the `nexusx.use_case` package) eagerly pulled `typer` even if the CLI was never touched — inconsistent with how `nexusx.mcp` guards `fastmcp` (`TYPE_CHECKING` + lazy runtime import). Fix: `import nexusx` no longer eagerly loads `typer`; users need not install `nexusx[cli]` to use non-CLI entry points. `create_use_case_cli()` is unchanged (lazy-imports `typer` on first call). Public API surface unchanged.

### 3.0.0 (2026-6-20)

- breaking change:
  - **Removed the old direct-call UseCase MCP entry points**: Introduced a new execution chain where `UseCaseService` auto-generates a **real GraphQL schema** and builds the MCP service on top (mirroring pydantic-resolve's compose). Two old direct-call use_case MCP entry points (invoke-Python-method-with-JSON-args) are hard-removed. The GraphQL/MCP-orthogonal `create_use_case_router` (FastAPI REST) and `create_use_case_voyager` (visualization) are unchanged. Removed: `create_use_case_mcp_server` (4-layer MCP, Layer 3 = `call_use_case` direct method call) → `create_use_case_mcp_server` (Layer 3 = `compose_query` taking a GraphQL string); `create_use_case_flat_server` (one-method-one-tool flat MCP) → `create_use_case_mcp_server`; `ServiceIntrospector` (SDL-style strings) → `ComposeSchema` (real introspection JSON + SDL). Migration: `docs/migrations/3.0-use-case-graphql.md`. Version: strict semver — public API removal = major (2.10.1 → 3.0.0).
- feat:
  - **UseCase GraphQL + 4-layer MCP**: New public API: `create_use_case_mcp_server(apps, name)` (4-layer progressive disclosure: `list_apps` → `describe_compose_schema` → `describe_compose_method` → `compose_query`); `build_compose_schema(app) -> ComposeSchema`; `ComposeSchema` (`render_introspection()`/`render_sdl()`/`render_method_sdl()`); `compose_introspect(schema, query)` (GraphiQL-style introspection, paired with MCP Layer 3 which rejects introspection — MCP uses progressive disclosure, HTTP GraphiQL uses full introspection); `ComposeSchemaError` and subclasses. Fixed three-layer schema (`Query` → `*ServiceQuery` → methods). Layer 3 takes a standard GraphQL string and **rejects introspection** (`__schema`/`__type`/`__typename`), returning `{data: null, errors: [...]}` to steer exploration to Layers 1/2. Execution boundary: the GraphQL layer does **not** wrap the service method's return in another `Resolver` — the method already does `Resolver().resolve(dtos)` internally; the outer layer only calls the method → field projection (`subset.build_subset_model`) → serialization.
- preserved (unchanged):
  - `UseCaseService`/`BusinessMeta`/`@query`/`@mutation`/`FromContext`/`UseCaseAppConfig`, `create_use_case_router`, `create_use_case_jsonrpc_router`, `create_use_case_voyager`, and all GraphQL-mode capabilities (`GraphQLHandler`/`SDLGenerator`/existing `mcp/`).
